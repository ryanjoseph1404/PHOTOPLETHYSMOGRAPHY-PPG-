# PHOTOPLETHYSMOGRAPHY-PPG-
This project demonstrates the development of a Photoplethysmography (PPG) device utilizing a microcontroller and the TCRT5000 infrared reflective sensor. While the TCRT5000 is often used for line tracking, this implementation leverages its infrared emitter and phototransistor to detect volumetric changes in blood circulation.
